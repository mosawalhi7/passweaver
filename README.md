# PassWeaver (pwv)

PassWeaver (`pwv`) is a command-line tool that generates personalized password wordlists using a target's personal strings (names, nicknames, places), dates, and numbers.  
It creates rule-based combinations and leet/case variations to help build targeted wordlists for authorized security testing, password recovery, or research.
